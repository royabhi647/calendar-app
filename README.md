# React Monthly Calendar Timeline

This project is a React-based implementation of a monthly calendar timeline, similar in functionality to Mobiscroll's monthly calendar timeline, but built from scratch using the ViteJs framework.

## Features

- **Monthly Calendar View**: Displays a full month view with events.
- **Event Management**: Allows users to drag to select time slots, add new events, and move events horizontally across dates.
- **Resource Management**: Functionality to add more resources on the Y-axis of the calendar.
- **Date Navigation**: Navigate to previous or next months.
- **Event Deletion**: Events can be deleted with a confirmation alert popup.
- **Date Highlighting**: Automatically highlights today's date.
- **Persistence**: Maintains state even after a hard refresh using local storage.

## Technology Stack

- **ReactJs**: For building the user interface.
- **ViteJs**: Used as the frontend build tool.
- **CSS**: For styling components.
